Bitcoin uses SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)-256 hash. SHA-256 is an algorithm that simply turns any kind of data into a standard-size (256 bits) hash.

One input always generates the same hash,

but it is impossible to predict the input back from the hash.
In the context of blockchain and digital currencies, "hashing" is the process of applying a mathematical function,

called a hash function, to a block of data to produce a fixed-size output, 


called a hash or a digest. The hash function is designed to be a one-way function, 
meaning that it is computationally infeasible to determine the original input data from the hash.

In the case of Bitcoin, the input data for the hash function is a block of transactions,
and the miner's task is to find a hash that meets certain criteria, such as having a certain number of leading zeroes.
The miner achieves this by iteratively adding a small number, called a nonce, to the input data and computing the hash.

When the miner finds a hash that meets the criteria, it is considered a solution to the mathematical problem,
and the miner can add the block of transactions to the blockchain.

The specific hash function used by Bitcoin is called SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit). It is a widely used,
one-way hash function that produces a 256-bit digest from any input data. The hash is a unique representation of the data,
any change in the data, no matter how small, will produce a completely different hash. This feature makes it suitable for uses such as digital signatures,
file integrity verification and in the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.

It is important to note that as the miner's computational power increases,
the difficulty of finding the solution adjusts to make the process more challenging, 
leading to the need for more computational power to continue to solve the problems and mint new coins.
